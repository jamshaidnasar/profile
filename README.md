# 👋 Hi, I’m **Jamshaid Nasar**

### **Backend-Focused Full-Stack Engineer**

**Remote · EU → US Time Overlap**

I’m a backend-focused full-stack engineer who builds **clean, reliable, production-ready web applications**.

My strength is designing **robust backend systems and APIs**, while still being fully capable of delivering **end-to-end products** with modern frontends. I care deeply about **code quality, clarity, and long-term maintainability**.

I’m preparing for **full-time remote work with U.S. companies**, and I’m available during **EU evenings with strong U.S. overlap**.

* Build **RESTful APIs** and backend services
* Design **scalable and maintainable architectures**
